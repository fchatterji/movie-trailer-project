# udacity_project_movie_trailer

This website displays some of my favorite movies. By clicking on a movie, the trailer is played.

To show the website, execute the file entertainment_center.py in the command line.

To add or change movies, edit the file entertainement_center.py.



This project is part of the udacity full stack web developper course.
